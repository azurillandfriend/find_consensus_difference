# find_consensus_difference
Counts the number of sites differing in the consensus sequences (opposite homozygoutes) between sets of Anopheles gambiae.
This was used to calculate the sites differing between potential cross fathers from Kisumu and Nagongera colonies as shown in table 3 of Dyer et al 2023
The code is a jupyter notebook (Potential_Fathers_GCS_Access_gamb_colu_filter_updated180723). This should be run as a jupyter notebook. It is not recommended to try and run this using google colab (on free setting) as it will run out of resources.
